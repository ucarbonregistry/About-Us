The requirements set out the principles and methodologies under the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism Approved Methodologies. UCR principles are the same but further rely on International Standards. All climate projects must comply with the UCR Standard, the UCR Program Manual and ISO 14064-2:2019. They must further be verified by an independent third party UCR approved accredited certification body, to be eligible for registration and issuance of carbon credits. All requirements are accessible under the Documentation section.
